# Stock-Analysis-Dashboard

A stock price analysis dashboard created with Python's Dash library.

The present project aims to exploit Dash's potential in making highly interactive dashboards.

We are going to construct an application that can expose different sorts of informations from some of IBOVESPA's most prominent stocks. I've mainly taken Trading View's website as a layout inspiration.
