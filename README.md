# Stock-Analysis-Dashboard
A stock price analysis dashboard created with Python's Dash library.

The present project aims to exploit Dash's potential in creating highly interactive dashboards.

We are going to construct an application that can expose different kinds of information from some of IBOVESPA's stocks. I've mainly taken Trading View's website as a layout inspiration.
